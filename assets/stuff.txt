I'm Amy!

I've always wanted a nickname but unfortunately it doesn't get any shorter than this.

In terms of CS, I'm interested in a variety of things -- still traversing that well-paved road of higher education.
But I have a lot of experience in CS education and software practices.

I've got grips on Java and Javascript mainly, a forgotten semester each of C and C++. And an obscure subset of Lisp called Racket.

LaTeX, bash, ...

Statistics, math and CS.
